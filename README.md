# Simple Audio Transcription and Summarization App

This application is designed to transcribe and summarize audio files using Whisper and Hugging Face's transformers. It's built with Streamlit, making it easy to deploy as a web app. Here's how it works and how you can set it up.

## Features

- **Audio Transcription**: Converts speech in audio files to text.
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detects the language of the audio file.
- **Summarization**: Provides a concise summary of the transcribed text.
- **Streamlit Integration**: Easy-to-use web interface for uploading audio files and viewing results.

## How It Works

The `transcribe_and_summarize` function performs the core operations:

1. **Audio File Processing**: Temporarily saves the uploaded audio file for processing.
2. **Whisper Model Loading**: Uses OpenAI's Whisper model for transcription and language detection.
3. **Audio Preprocessing**: Converts the audio to a format suitable for the Whisper model.
4. **Language Detection**: Determines the most probable language of the audio content.
5. **Transcription**: Transcribes the audio file to text.
6. **Summarization**: Uses a Hugging Face summarization pipeline to create a summary of the transcribed text.
7. **Streamlit UI**: Provides an interface for uploading audio files and displays the detected language, transcribed text, and summary.
